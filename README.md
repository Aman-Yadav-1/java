# Java : Data Structure & Algorithm

<b>What is Data Structure & Why learn it?<b> <br>
     <p> A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data.<br>
     And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.<br>
     Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.<br>
     In this repository I have uploaded and implemented various DSA questions in java.<br>
     </p>

It contains-
> 1. Pattern Questions
> 2. Array Questions
> 3. Functions
> 4. String Question
*and other basic questions*
